# Competitive Programming Practice Repository

![Repository Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-brightgreen)

## Overview
Welcome to my Competitive Programming Practice repository! This repo contains a curated collection of LeetCode problems organized by topic, with detailed solutions implemented mostly as Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`). It’s created as part of my journey to master algorithmic problem-solving through organized, systematic practice.

Whether you’re a beginner or looking for structured practice material, this repository aims to help you strengthen your problem-solving skills by reviewing problems by topics like Arrays, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, and more.

---

## Folder & File Structure
- Each **topic** has its own folder (e.g., `Arrays`, `Graphs`, `DP`) for easy navigation.
- Inside each folder, you’ll find Jupyter notebooks that:
  - Explain the problem statement.
  - Provide intuitive explanations and step-by-step solutions.
  - Include the code implementation and test cases.
- Additional resources such as cheat sheets or tips may be included in some folders.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab environment
- Necessary libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` etc. (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt` if supplied)

### Running Notebooks
1. Clone this repository:
 ```bash
